# Inflammation Biomarkers and Risk of Cardiovascular-related Mortality

Inflammation plays an essential role in the development of atherosclerosis leading to cardiovascular disease. The aim of this research study is to assess the relationship between inflammatory biomarkers and the risk of cardiovascular-disease related mortality specifically within the population of interest, adults 65 years and older. C-reactive protein and fibrinogen in the blood are known inflammation biomarkers. The main research question of the current study is as follows: do inflammation biomarkers, including blood C-reactive protein (CRP) and blood fibrinogen, and health status measures, such as systolic blood pressure, have a significant effect on risk of cardiovascular-related mortality?


## Results

### Logistic Regression Model
Results of the reduced model with influential points included (Pseudo-R2 = 0.10, AIC = 2585.97, BIC = 2657.08) indicate that all predictors are significant except fib, blood fibrinogen level (p = .34).
Results of the reduced model with influential points removed (Pseudo-R2 = 0.11,  AIC =2431.51, BIC =2502.57) indicate all predictors are significant except fib, blood fibrinogen level (p = .32). 

### Weighted Logistic Regression Model
Results of the weighted reduced model with influential points included (Pseudo-R2 = 0.41, AIC =  9446.85, BIC = 9524.48) indicate that all predictors are significant. 
Results of the weighted reduced model with influential points removed (Pseudo-R2 = 0.43, AIC = 9191.89, BIC = 9269.48) indicate that all predictors are significant.
